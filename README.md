# Escape Room Project

## Project Overview

This is the Escape Room Project, where I developed a text-based game that simulates a maze and the main goal is to find the exit. The project was implemented using Python, and it was a great experience where I was able to apply some of the knowlege acquired on the first week of my Data Analytics bootcamp, such as - Python Structures/Functions/Flow Control/Error Handling and adding features using new modules.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with multiple rooms and objects.
- Since it is a text-based game added enhancement to different words, so the user can identify the text in an easier way.
  - (ie. Object text in bold; object interaction text in green/red based on its matter for the progress of the game; linebreaks to better text structure)
- Added a user input before the game starts to collect the player name.
- Displayed a timer to track how long it takes the user to escape.

## Instalation

- The game was implemented using google colab, and it was split in two different files - the main file (jupyter notebook) and the functions file (python).
- So, the best and easiest way to set up and play the game is to clone this repository and open both files - main and functions - on your IDE and add them together instead of importing.
